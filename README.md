# Forest Fire Fuel Prediction for Non-Wildfire Managed Forest Areas
## Developed by Anthony Castillo in conjunction with Christopher Potter at the NASA Ames Research Center.

In this research project we used SciKit-Learn to create a Random Forest Regressor with a Randomized Search Cross Validation sequence for hyper parameter tuning.  The model had a 67.1% + or - 2.0% accuracy for predicting Carbon values (mg C/ha) based on our input variables of average forest age, Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), average precipitation, average temperature, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
